## ServiceDesk Plus

ServiceDesk Plus is an open-source ticketing system, and the actions performed by these API calls depend to
some extent on the configuration of the ServiceDesk Plus instance.

**This connector provides an integration with ServiceDesk Plus On-Premises ONLY**

### On Poll

-   The `On Poll` action works in 2 steps: 
    * All the tickets (issues) will be fetched in defined time duration
    * All the components (e.g. fields) of the tickets (retrieved in the first step) will be fetched. A container will be created for each ticket and for each ticket all the components will be created as the respective artifacts.
-   The tickets will be fetched in the **oldest first order** based on the **updated** time in the `On Poll` action


### Authentication

`Authtoken` is used for authentication purposes.

* Every user with login permission can generate one with/without expiry date
* A technician with `SDAdmin` role can generate the key for other technicians as well
* Through this key, a technician is identified and operations are performed, based on the role provided to that technician 
* If the login credentials of the Technician are disabled, the correspoding key will be deleted

#### Generate API key

Access your ServiceDesk Plus instance via UI and go to *Admin -> Technicians*.

* For **existing** technician
    * click the *Edit* icon beside that Technician
* For a **new** technician
    * click the *Add New Technician* link
    * enter the technician details and provide login permission 
    * click the *Generate* link under the API key details block 
    * select a time frame for the key to expire using the *Calendar* icon, or simply retain the same key perpetually 
    
    > If a key is already generated for the Technician, a *Re-generate* link appears. A time frame for the key is selected, within which the key expires. [The time frame shows the date, month, year and time (in hours and minutes)]
